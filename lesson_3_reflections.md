# When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share code with the rest of your team. When you want to ensure that you have more than one copy, i.e. a backup in case of loss or damage to your computer. When you want to be able to work remotely on multiple machines. When you want to make your code public / open source / collaborate.

# Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because pulling files down might overwrite the work you have done on your local machine.
