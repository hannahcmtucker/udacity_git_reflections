# What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git hidden directory is created which will contain all the tracking metadata associated with the repo

# How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

You can add files to the staging area before committing them; intermediate between the working directory and the repository. This allows you to choose which files you want to add. Can add multiple, one at a time, and then commit whole staging area bundled together
